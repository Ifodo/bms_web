1. Login Page
Design a futuristic login page for a Battery Management System (BMS) web dashboard. The UI should use Tailwind CSS styling principles — clean, minimalistic, and futuristic. Center a login card on a gradient or glassmorphic background with a glowing neon battery icon or logo above the form.

Include fields for email and password with rounded input boxes, a "Remember Me" toggle, and a bold "Login" button in electric blue or neon green. Add subtle animated particles or flowing gradient effects in the background. Place a small “Forgot Password?” link and a switch to the registration page. Typography should be sleek and high-tech.

2. Registration Page
Create a sleek and futuristic registration page for a BMS UI using Tailwind CSS design trends. The screen should feature a centered card with soft shadows and glassmorphism style.

Include input fields for Full Name, Email, Password, Confirm Password, and a Role dropdown (e.g., Admin, Technician). Design input elements with glowing borders on focus and a large neon green "Register" button. Show a subtle animated illustration or icon representing smart energy or batteries on one side. Keep the page airy and developer-friendly, using modern spacing and grid.

3. Dashboard Overview Page
Generate a modern and data-rich BMS dashboard overview page following futuristic UI trends and Tailwind CSS aesthetics.

Include a sidebar with glowing icons (Dashboard, Alerts, Cells, Maps, Settings), a top nav with user profile and search, and a main content panel. Display an at-a-glance battery status card (SOC%, temperature, voltage, current) and interactive widgets like:

Line chart for voltage trends

Circular gauge for SOC

Bar graph for temperature

Live alerts section

Use dark mode with neon highlights and modular cards with smooth hover animations. Ensure clean grid layout and developer-friendly UI.

4. Battery Cell Details Page
Design a futuristic Battery Cell Details page showing data from 24 cells in a high-tech grid layout. Each cell should be represented as a card showing:

Cell number

Voltage

Temperature

Status indicator (color-coded)

Use Tailwind CSS visual trends like neumorphism, hover transitions, and responsive grid. Add filtering options and a toggle to switch between voltage and temperature views. Use a black or graphite background with electric blue and neon green highlights.

5. Alerts & Notifications Page
Create an advanced BMS Alerts & Notifications page with a dark futuristic interface. Show a table or card list of recent alerts such as "Overvoltage", "Overheating", "Low SOC", with:

Timestamp

Severity (color-coded tags)

Affected cell

Action buttons (Acknowledge, View Details)

Use glowing borders, icons for alert types, and expandable panels for details. Add filter and sort dropdowns at the top. Animate alert cards subtly to draw attention without being disruptive.

6. Map & Location Page
Generate a smart Map page for the BMS system showing the real-time location of tracked battery units. Use a dark-themed futuristic map (like Mapbox or 3D-style) with glowing pins.

Show each battery unit as a pulsing icon with basic info on hover (SOC, status, last ping). Include filters for status (OK, Warning, Fault) and time range. Add a side panel listing all units with live metrics. Incorporate Tailwind-styled cards and responsive layout.

7. Settings Page
Design a futuristic BMS Settings page using Tailwind CSS-inspired UI. Split the layout into sections:

User Profile (avatar, name, email)

Preferences (dark/light mode toggle, language)

System Config (thresholds, unit selection, alert config)

Use toggle switches, sliders, and dropdowns with glowing styles. Animate transitions between tabs and sections. Use a glass-like card layout with rounded borders and high-contrast text. Focus on clarity and modern usability.
